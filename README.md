# MIT OCW 6.0002 Fall 2016
#
# My greatest appreciation for all those involved in creating and maintaining the MIT OCW 6.0002 Fall 2016 course.
# This includes Prof. Eric Grimson, Prof. John Guttag, Dr. Ana Bell, and all others involved.
# I in no way claim ownership for the assignment code as supplied; I merely solved the assignments like any other student would have.
